# MinsuThetaDine -> REST API with .NET 8 and DDD Clean Architecture
# Overview
I am going to build a robust CRUD REST API for managing breakfast items from scratch using .NET 8. The backend system is designed with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and follows a clean architecture approach. The API supports basic operations such as Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting breakfasts.

# Technologies and Libraries
.NET 8: The foundation of our application. </br>
DDD (Domain-Driven Design): A design approach that structures the codebase around the business domain.</br>
Clean Architecture: A software design philosophy emphasizing separation of concerns and maintaining a clear architecture.</br>
Mapster: A library for object-to-object mapping, helping with DTO (Data Transfer Object) transformations.</br>
Mediatr: Implements the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern for better separation of concerns.</br>
FluentValidation: A library for building strongly-typed validation rules.</br>
BCrypt: Used for secure password hashing.</br>
ErrorOr: A pattern for handling errors in a functional way.</br>
Aggregate Roots: Used to represent consistency boundaries in the domain.</br>
# Patterns
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)</br>
The application follows the CQRS pattern, separating the command (write) and query (read) responsibilities to improve scalability and maintainability.

# Repository Pattern
We use the repository pattern to abstract the data access logic, providing a clean and consistent interface for working with data.

# Unit of Work
The Unit of Work pattern is implemented to manage transactions and ensure that all changes are persisted or rolled back as a single atomic operation.

# Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the breakfast API locally:

# Clone the repository.
Install the necessary dependencies using your package manager.</br>
Configure your database connection and other settings in the app configuration.</br>
Run the database migrations to create the required tables.</br>
Build and run the application.</br>
Refer to the detailed documentation and code comments for more information on each step.</br>
